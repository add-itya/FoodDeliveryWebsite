# FoodDeliveryWebsite
Website made with HTML and CSS. This website is meant for someone intending to promote their food business and their services. It is responsive so that the website adjusts to the resolutions present in most devices.


Functionalities:
-The navigation bar at the top of the website is sticky, and upon clicking on each of the sections, the website takes you to that section
!!!There is no backend and thus the contact form will not work, but I would connect it to an e-mail so that the responses go straight there !!!
-The images, text, borders, boxes, forms, all adjust based on the resolution of the screen, or even if its in window
-CSS was used to style all the different website elements
-Smooth scrolling was implemented
